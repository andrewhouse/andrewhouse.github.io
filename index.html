  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is my last week at The Iron Yard.<br>
It feels like the last 11 weeks have flown by, mainly because I have been having a ridiculous amount of fun.
I have been stressed, anxious, and nervous.
Learning how to cope with all is part of being a developer.
To take the negative feelings and look beyond them.
<br>&ldquo;Why am I feeling stressed? I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting this to work.&rdquo;<br>
Understanding yourself and the root of your feelings can be a driving force.
After understanding the stress, I can redirect it into a thirst for knowledge.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be happy and sad after my demo day is done.
Happy that I had completed the course to the best of my abilities, learning so many different things.
Sad that the environment that I have been in, everyone giving 100% to learn, will be over.
But alas!
A new chapter will start, with great people with great purposes.
Life is pretty cool if you give it a chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That was intense.<br>
I had a really fun time this weekend.
It&rsquo;s amazing how much can be accomplished in such a short amount of time.
I went into the hackathon with the mindset of building something that would work when it was over.
I was successful.<br><br>
Our app was a pseudo dropbox that would be used by businesses and allow clients to
download/upload files without making an account.
I took the task of scrumming together a work flow for my team for the weekend,
gathering input from a couple of the pitchers.
Because of this, we never had a situation where we asked what was next.
At the end, I was told that I looked and acted like a project manager.
 Also, our app looked like an enterprise worthy application,
and was planned and built accordingly.
That was a pretty nice ego boost, to get feedback from strangers that my
techniques in building and managing and application are very effective.<br><br>
Working with a front end developer and an IOS developer was very fun.
Being able to cultivate my data to tailor their needs was different.
Our front end developer was very fresh to The Iron Yard (2 weeks in)
and was a stellar developer.
I took the time Saturday to teach him Haml and he took to it quickly(major props to you Dean).
Being on a team like that was worth the whole weekend to me.
To be around minds who also had a thirst for knowldge and had a different perspective on everything.
I look at things very logically, they had a much better perspective on design and user expereience.
I had a great team and more importantly had an absolute blast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So in about 20 minutes the internal hackathon at The Iron Yard Atlanta is going to begin. <br>
I&rsquo;m pretty pumped.<br>
Not really knowing what I&rsquo;m going to be building.<br>
Who I&rsquo;m going to be working with.<br>
If I&rsquo;ll be able to do everything I want to in the time frame (probably not).<br>
All of these variables seem like it&rsquo;s going to bring an epic weekend.<br><br>
The teams are going to be preselected.
Each team will get at least one Rails Engineer, IOS Developer, and Front End Developer.
Most teams will be groups of 3, some groups of 4.
I&rsquo;m hoping to think that my team is going to be extraordinarily bad ass.
Well to be perfectly honest, everyone at The Iron Yard has talent.
Everyone will be able to contribute something.
I know going into it that I want my team to scrum our project.
I already have a nice spreadsheet laid out and ready to go.
Now it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we start.<br><br>
I&rsquo;m excited.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s about to get crazy at The Iron Yard.<br>
We have a week and a half of lecture and practice until we begin final projects.
Honestly, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to do.
I know that I would love to build a site combining the strengths of Rails backend with Angular JS&rsquo;s front end.
I suck at ideas though.
If I have an idea of what to build, the general idea, then I can run with it and do something fun.
Getting that initial idea is hard as hell for me.
I plan on asking various people to get their advise for what kind of project would be memorable and useable.
From October 3-5 The Iron Yard is doing an internal hackathon (Combination of the Front End, IOS, and Rails classes) and I hope that I get an idea from there that I can run with for my final project.
I would love to work with other classes and form a Scrum centric idea process and work flow to knock down a project.<br> <br>
The last couple of weeks have been group projects for us.
Last week I was the project leader of our group and it was very different experience for me.
I didn&rsquo;t do pure scrum with the group.
I didn&rsquo;t get client input, or make a board.
I kind of winged the inputs in my head to develop a MVP.
This week the leader of our group was a former project manager, <a href="https://github.com/rjgroller">Robert Groller</a>, and knows how to use scrum.
Actual scrum implementation is much different than &ldquo;winging it&rdquo;.
I like the workflow process much better with full scrum.
The timeboxing, workflow, and everything.
I want this process in my final project.
My intention is to have James, my teacher, act as the client and give me feedback on what he thinks a user experience should find important in whatever I do. <br><br>
Now I just need to figure out what I&rsquo;m going to do.
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll figure it out soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this article I&rsquo;ll detail the process of logging into google via the
<a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">Omniauth Gem</a>.<br>
I set up my code almost the same as how my teacher, <a href="https://github.com/jamesdabbs">James Dabbs</a>
at The Iron yard. Also keep in mind that <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a>
is needed to be setup before omniauth will work.<br></p>

<h3>Getting Set Up</h3>


<p>The first thing we will do is add of the gems and gem dependencies
we&rsquo;re going to need for logging into google.
There are two gems that are going to be needed.
The first is the actual Omniauth Gem and the second can be found
<a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">on the list of provider gems</a>
that are supported with Omniauth.
I decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2">google-oath-2</a>
gem.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile</span><a href='https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;omniauth&#39;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hashie&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Note: Always run bundle after changing your gemfile</em><br>
<em>Note: I&rsquo;ll go into the purpose of Hashie in the identifier section</em><br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is becoming a trend for websites to enable logging into that website
via another.<br>
We&rsquo;ve all seen it.
The buttons that say &ldquo;Sign in with Facebook&rdquo;, or various other
providers.
For some reason unknown to me (really unknown to me because I don&rsquo;t
use social media), seeing these logins provide some kind of weird
validity to a website.
It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, they are connected with facebook, they must be credible&rdquo;.
When I know perfectly well that its just a little bit of code hooking into
the facebook api.
Regardless, implementing these login features for a user is a
great strategy from a user experience (UX) standpoint.<br><br>
Over the next few blog posts I&rsquo;m going to go over step by step
using provider authentication, and being able to use multiple
providers for the same user.
I feel logging into various providers is a valuable skill for every Rails developer, and
a great tool to be able to use.<br>
In the upcoming posts, I&rsquo;ll use Amazon and Google as my examples.
I&rsquo;ll also detail what is needed to add another provider, and some quirks
about certain ones (Twitter).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is so much I don&rsquo;t know about security.<br>
Yet it is so fascinating.
Yesterday I attended a workshop hosted by <a href="https://nvisium.com/">Nvisium</a>, with the premise
of discussing vulnerabilities in Rails and how to avoid them.
It amazes me how much security professionals know.
In order to understand security, you need to know everything about
the framework you&rsquo;re using, as well as exactly how the web works.<br><br>
The workshop was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/cktricky">Ken Johnson</a>, the
CTO of Nvisium.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of exactly what we did and what we covered.
Instead I&rsquo;ll focus on mainly what I gained from the workshop.
For me, Security has three faces.<br><br>
The first face is owned by the designers and those who develop the front
end.
For them, the only care for security is that it is there, but doesn&rsquo;t
change how they want to order and design the page. <br><br>
The second face is owned by the developers who want to get code to work.
I am guilty of this.
I generally attack code trying to get a feature to work, not really thinking
about how the parameter I have listed could be sql injected or could
give away a person&rsquo;s id to allow to try to narrow down who is admin
and try to attack that specific person.<br><br>
The last side lies on the ones who want to protect security.
For them, trying to convince the first two to use best security practices
must be an absolute headache.
To take a feature that looks the way the design team wants, and functions
the way the developers want, and tell them that they are vulnerable
to attacks.
It seems to me that they would always be the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; guy in that situation.
People care about security, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t effect their daily lives.<br><br>
I took a lot of notes and got a ton of resources from the workshop.
My plan is to try to do the best I can do make sure that I plug the big
holes of security in my apps.
I know that at my current state of being a junior developer that it would
be impossible to try and do everything, but I will take all the
necessary steps to prevent my app from being completely vulnerable.<br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We go through material so fast at The Iron Yard.<br>
It isn&rsquo;t like we go through things too fast, but just fast enough
to understand everything.
I personally have a tendency to forget basic syntax when blazing through
new material.<br>
Do I put a semi-colon here or wrap it in quotation marks?<br>
Do I need curly brackets here?<br>
Little details like that come up often in my brain.
I find it helpful to try to not remember the exact syntax, but where
I wrote code similar to that to reference.
That way I&rsquo;m not trying to rush and memorize specific syntax, but
over time as I continuously refer to my own work it will become
more normal.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy looking at code that I have wrote before.
Especially code that I don&rsquo;t remember.
I can see my progress and have the &ldquo;what was I thinking when I wrote this?&rdquo;
moments.
To be able to mock my previous self is crucial in self evolution.
See what I did, and make it better.
Then I&rsquo;m not just referencing some article online, but take something
that I put time into and make a new reference by upgrading it.
There is always something to do.
Code can always be smaller, faster, and more efficient.
It&rsquo;s my job to find a perfect balance between those and the time it takes
to write the code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>AngularJS is so badass.<br>
This past week, I&rsquo;ve been working non-stop on the Homework App
James(my teacher at The Iron Yard) and I have been building.
As an admin, James can post assignments and students can post
the link to their homework and let us know if they are finished or not.
We were trying to figure out a way to be able to easily search through
all of the assignments and be able to display specific dates, titles, or
even the description of the assignment.
This is where AngularJS came in.<br><br>
My knowledge of AngularJS coming into this was pretty minimal.
I knew the basics of how it was supposed to work and some of the power
behind it.
I didn&rsquo;t know how to hook Rails data into Angular.
The only hint James gave me was that I would need to use ngResource.
After reading several articles, I found a nice little snippet of code
that appeared to use Rails rendered data in Json format.<br>
Perfect!<br>
From there I was able to grab the data and implement a new table using
only Angular.<br>
Once the table was complete, I started on the journey of implementing
the search function.
After playing around for a few minutes and figuring out where I needed
to put in the filters, I was having a problem saying exactly what
I wanted to search for.
I talked to James and he showed me how to create my own filter in Angular.
From there I built the search filter&hellip;and holy shit it worked.<br>
I was amazed.<br>
I had integrated a working AngularJS search function into my app and
it worked wonderfully.
Mixing in languages was difficult, but a ton of fun.
I feel like I learned some valuable skills while implementing this.
Coding is so much fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been living in a state of being uncomfortable.<br>
It&rsquo;s a weird feeling.
Always having to look up resources, reading articles, and watching videos.<br>
It is constant learning.<br>
At first, this style was incredibly uneasy.
I would feel constantly anxious and stressed.
Why didn&rsquo;t I have the answers?
Why was I having such a hard time finding answers?
There is a great skill in asking the right questions, and a very valuable lesson
I learned.
I think my next blog post will be how to google 101, or googling for rails dummies.
The evolution of my ability to see through what problem I am facing and
being able to search for that specific problem has been astonishing.
I&rsquo;m starting to transition from being uneasy all the time to enjoying the hunt.<br><br>
Where are the answers?<br>
Which answer is the best for my needs?<br>
Can I tweak the answer to get better results?<br><br>
I feel like this is a great mentality to have.
To be always improving is what it takes to be a developer.
Breaking my old ways of doing what it is easy, digging into the trenches,
and putting some sweat equity into me.
It&rsquo;s a pretty rewarding feeling.
Looking at myself from the outside in and noticing a change.
I am so glad that I am coding.
It truly was a life altering choice to come to The Iron Yard.
Not only will I become a badass Rails Dev, but I will also be closer to
my true self.</p>
