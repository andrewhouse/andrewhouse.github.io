  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this article I&rsquo;ll detail the process of logging into google via the
<a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">Omniauth Gem</a>.<br>
I set up my code almost the same as how my teacher, <a href="https://github.com/jamesdabbs">James Dabbs</a>
at The Iron yard. Also keep in mind that <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a>
is needed to be setup before omniauth will work.<br></p>

<h3>Getting Set Up</h3>


<p>The first thing we will do is add of the gems and gem dependencies
we&rsquo;re going to need for logging into google.
There are two gems that are going to be needed.
The first is the actual Omniauth Gem and the second can be found
<a href="gem" title="omniauth-google-oauth2">on the list of provider gems</a>
that are supported with Omniauth.
I decided to use the [google-oath-2][<a href="https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2">https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2</a>]
gem.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile</span><a href='https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Note: Always run bundle after changing your gemfile</em><br>
<em>Note: I&rsquo;ll go into the purpose of Hashie in the identifier section</em><br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is becoming a trend for websites to enable logging into that website
via another.<br>
We&rsquo;ve all seen it.
The buttons that say &ldquo;Sign in with Facebook&rdquo;, or various other
providers.
For some reason unknown to me (really unknown to me because I don&rsquo;t
use social media), seeing these logins provide some kind of weird
validity to a website.
It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, they are connected with facebook, they must be credible&rdquo;.
When I know perfectly well that its just a little bit of code hooking into
the facebook api.
Regardless, implementing these login features for a user is a
great strategy from a user experience (UX) standpoint.<br><br>
Over the next few blog posts I&rsquo;m going to go over step by step
using provider authentication, and being able to use multiple
providers for the same user.
I feel logging into various providers is a valuable skill for every Rails developer, and
a great tool to be able to use.<br>
In the upcoming posts, I&rsquo;ll use Amazon and Google as my examples.
I&rsquo;ll also detail what is needed to add another provider, and some quirks
about certain ones (Twitter).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is so much I don&rsquo;t know about security.<br>
Yet it is so fascinating.
Yesterday I attended a workshop hosted by <a href="https://nvisium.com/">Nvisium</a>, with the premise
of discussing vulnerabilities in Rails and how to avoid them.
It amazes me how much security professionals know.
In order to understand security, you need to know everything about
the framework you&rsquo;re using, as well as exactly how the web works.<br><br>
The workshop was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/cktricky">Ken Johnson</a>, the
CTO of Nvisium.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of exactly what we did and what we covered.
Instead I&rsquo;ll focus on mainly what I gained from the workshop.
For me, Security has three faces.<br><br>
The first face is owned by the designers and those who develop the front
end.
For them, the only care for security is that it is there, but doesn&rsquo;t
change how they want to order and design the page. <br><br>
The second face is owned by the developers who want to get code to work.
I am guilty of this.
I generally attack code trying to get a feature to work, not really thinking
about how the parameter I have listed could be sql injected or could
give away a person&rsquo;s id to allow to try to narrow down who is admin
and try to attack that specific person.<br><br>
The last side lies on the ones who want to protect security.
For them, trying to convince the first two to use best security practices
must be an absolute headache.
To take a feature that looks the way the design team wants, and functions
the way the developers want, and tell them that they are vulnerable
to attacks.
It seems to me that they would always be the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; guy in that situation.
People care about security, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t effect their daily lives.<br><br>
I took a lot of notes and got a ton of resources from the workshop.
My plan is to try to do the best I can do make sure that I plug the big
holes of security in my apps.
I know that at my current state of being a junior developer that it would
be impossible to try and do everything, but I will take all the
necessary steps to prevent my app from being completely vulnerable.<br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We go through material so fast at The Iron Yard.<br>
It isn&rsquo;t like we go through things too fast, but just fast enough
to understand everything.
I personally have a tendency to forget basic syntax when blazing through
new material.<br>
Do I put a semi-colon here or wrap it in quotation marks?<br>
Do I need curly brackets here?<br>
Little details like that come up often in my brain.
I find it helpful to try to not remember the exact syntax, but where
I wrote code similar to that to reference.
That way I&rsquo;m not trying to rush and memorize specific syntax, but
over time as I continuously refer to my own work it will become
more normal.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy looking at code that I have wrote before.
Especially code that I don&rsquo;t remember.
I can see my progress and have the &ldquo;what was I thinking when I wrote this?&rdquo;
moments.
To be able to mock my previous self is crucial in self evolution.
See what I did, and make it better.
Then I&rsquo;m not just referencing some article online, but take something
that I put time into and make a new reference by upgrading it.
There is always something to do.
Code can always be smaller, faster, and more efficient.
It&rsquo;s my job to find a perfect balance between those and the time it takes
to write the code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>AngularJS is so badass.<br>
This past week, I&rsquo;ve been working non-stop on the Homework App
James(my teacher at The Iron Yard) and I have been building.
As an admin, James can post assignments and students can post
the link to their homework and let us know if they are finished or not.
We were trying to figure out a way to be able to easily search through
all of the assignments and be able to display specific dates, titles, or
even the description of the assignment.
This is where AngularJS came in.<br><br>
My knowledge of AngularJS coming into this was pretty minimal.
I knew the basics of how it was supposed to work and some of the power
behind it.
I didn&rsquo;t know how to hook Rails data into Angular.
The only hint James gave me was that I would need to use ngResource.
After reading several articles, I found a nice little snippet of code
that appeared to use Rails rendered data in Json format.<br>
Perfect!<br>
From there I was able to grab the data and implement a new table using
only Angular.<br>
Once the table was complete, I started on the journey of implementing
the search function.
After playing around for a few minutes and figuring out where I needed
to put in the filters, I was having a problem saying exactly what
I wanted to search for.
I talked to James and he showed me how to create my own filter in Angular.
From there I built the search filter&hellip;and holy shit it worked.<br>
I was amazed.<br>
I had integrated a working AngularJS search function into my app and
it worked wonderfully.
Mixing in languages was difficult, but a ton of fun.
I feel like I learned some valuable skills while implementing this.
Coding is so much fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been living in a state of being uncomfortable.<br>
It&rsquo;s a weird feeling.
Always having to look up resources, reading articles, and watching videos.<br>
It is constant learning.<br>
At first, this style was incredibly uneasy.
I would feel constantly anxious and stressed.
Why didn&rsquo;t I have the answers?
Why was I having such a hard time finding answers?
There is a great skill in asking the right questions, and a very valuable lesson
I learned.
I think my next blog post will be how to google 101, or googling for rails dummies.
The evolution of my ability to see through what problem I am facing and
being able to search for that specific problem has been astonishing.
I&rsquo;m starting to transition from being uneasy all the time to enjoying the hunt.<br><br>
Where are the answers?<br>
Which answer is the best for my needs?<br>
Can I tweak the answer to get better results?<br><br>
I feel like this is a great mentality to have.
To be always improving is what it takes to be a developer.
Breaking my old ways of doing what it is easy, digging into the trenches,
and putting some sweat equity into me.
It&rsquo;s a pretty rewarding feeling.
Looking at myself from the outside in and noticing a change.
I am so glad that I am coding.
It truly was a life altering choice to come to The Iron Yard.
Not only will I become a badass Rails Dev, but I will also be closer to
my true self.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m learning things way too fast.<br>
Currently I am in the process of building a web app for my class at The
Iron Yard.
The app is a centralized place where the teacher can post assignments
and we can post a link to our assignment and check to see if it is finished
or not.
It&rsquo;s going great and it is working.
However, I want it to do so much more.<br><br>
This weekend I found myself making profile pages for each user.
I&rsquo;m not any good at design so it was challenging for me to try to tap into
what little artistic vision I have.
Partway through implementing the design, I kept wanting to work on other
features and develop it so much further.
I want to add a better search feature using Angular (still working on
figuring it out), add a sort function for the assignments, add comments
on each individual assignment a student posts, and so much more!<br><br>
I have ideas galore on how to expand this to fit the needs for our class,
but I don&rsquo;t have enough time to implement them all.
While studying and learning new skills every day, and researching what I need
to do for the app.
I find myself trying to prioritize what features I want to do.
Do I take the least path of resistance and implement what would be easiest?
Or do I study a language I haven&rsquo;t used and try to work in this cool feature?<br><br>
The good news is that I am having fun and want to do them all.
Each feature is in its own a great challenge, and without challenges life is boring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic">Gravtastic</a> saves a ton of headaches when wanting a gravatar.<br>
In 4 lines of code (seriously 4) I had a gravatar up and running on my app.
Here&rsquo;s how. <br></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>Keep in mind, gravtastic relies on Devise to work. So all of the instructions are
to be used after Devise is setup.<br>
Go ahead and add the gem gravtastic to your Gemfile.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile</span><a href='https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;gravtastic&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><br>
As always, make sure to bundle after installing a gem.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal</span><a href='https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='console'><span class='line'><span class="go">bundle</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><br></p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>


<p>Now we need to make sure our model uses gravtastic. Your file may be different
depending on what you named your devise model.
I&rsquo;m going to name mine User and generate the code on that premise.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/models/user.rb</span><a href='https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Gravtastic</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">gravtastic</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><br>
With that gravtastic has been able to hook into your devise model. Hooray!
The last job is rendering the gravatar to the view.<br>
I&rsquo;m using Haml, so the html syntax may be weird. If you&rsquo;re using Erb, just
replace the = with &lt;%= and end the line with %></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/views/whicheverview.html.haml</span><a href='https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haml'><span class='line'><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">image_tag</span> <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gravatar_url</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><br>
That&rsquo;s it!<br>
Now a gravatar should be rendering on your page.
If you want to adjust the size you can pass a size option on gravtastic in the model.
The specifics of different options to use can be found on
the <a href="https://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic">Gravtastic Github Page</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think API&rsquo;s are amazing.<br>
It&rsquo;s kind of weird how much I&rsquo;m into API&rsquo;s lately.
Yet, I&rsquo;ve only technically made one (and oh my goodness was it a small one).
I hold much value in the flexibility that an API provides.
To be able to talk to multiple devises in different languages by only providing
the necessary data.<br><br>
Data is my thing.<br><br>
It&rsquo;s nice not having to worry about making anything pretty.
If I want to see if my data is working the way I want I can just do a quick curl.
I&rsquo;m currently having a problem figuring out authenticity tokens.
But that is okay, it&rsquo;s just another hurdle to overcome.<br><br>
When I can easily implement an API I feel as though my self worth will go up drastically.
Reason being, at The Iron Yard in Atlanta there are 3 cohorts (currently 2
  since the front end class just graduated) and a well developed API
  could easily tie together all 3 classes.
How cool is that?
To be able to work with multiple people on a singular project.<br>
All because data is badass.<br><br>
I look forward to creating amazing API&rsquo;s in the future and look forward to
understanding enough Angular JS to be able to call on my API&rsquo;s information.
Doing Full Stack work sounds like a lot of work and would be a ton of fun.<br>
I&rsquo;m excited about the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suck at testing.<br>
There are some things that click, and some that don&rsquo;t.
For me, testing doesn&rsquo;t click.
I understand the benefit of it, helping getting my thoughts in order and
drive code in a structured way.
I don&rsquo;t know if its the specific DSL of using rspec, or what.
But I am not good at it (yet).<br><br>
Since testing is my achilles heel, I&rsquo;ve decided to make it my prerogative
to get it down.
I don&rsquo;t want to back away from a challenge just because I don&rsquo;t get it at first.
It&rsquo;s completely okay that I&rsquo;m not good at testing right now.
The reason I&rsquo;m at The Iron Yard is because I don&rsquo;t have all the skills required
to be a proficient Junior Rails Developer at my current level.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to use the time that I have here to master any skills
that I&rsquo;m not good at.
Testing is currently at the top of my list.
Once I get it down (and I will get it down) I&rsquo;ll move on to the next beast.
Keep knocking them down one after another until I feel confident doing what I&rsquo;m doing.
Then when I&rsquo;m confident, look at some amazing code that I don&rsquo;t understand
and begin the journey again.
Learning is an ongoing process and it&rsquo;s something that is needed by a
web engineer.
To be able to continuously challenge myself and push into the next technology.
Adapting, evolving, and challenging.
Three things that I love to do and will continue to do for as long as I can.<br>
Coding is fun.
Always changing and never perfect.</p>
