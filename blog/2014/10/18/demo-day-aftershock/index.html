<div class="entry-content"><p>I came, I saw, and it was awesome.<br>
All of my fellow Rails classmates did amazing.
It was so much fun watching everyone go up and present their final projects.
Not a single person lacked passion and love for their project.
I have a lot of pride in my project, <a href="http://pricetimate.com">Pricimate</a>.<br><br>
The idea for my project came from my wife.
She&rsquo;s in touch with the artistic community and knew that there was a void for new artists.<br>
They don&rsquo;t know how to price their works of art for sell.<br>
So I made that my mission. <strong>Help Artists Price Their Work</strong>
I proceeded to scrum out what my wife/client believed to be important, calculated my story points for each, and found my priority list.<br>
For MVP, I got all of my basic features working in Rails.
But that wasn&rsquo;t good enough, I needed more dynamic features, so I proceeded to work in AngularJS.
In the end, my app worked exactly how I wanted it to.
<br><br>
I practiced my presentation many, many, many times.
Being 100% prepared was essential for me.
Stumbling, forgetting where I was, or skipping a few sentences were not things I was going to do.<br>
And I nailed it.<br>
We had 6 minutes alloted for presentations; Mine was 5:57 (we had a timer on our podium).
I felt like I had complete confidence in my app because I prepared as much as I did.
People had engaging questions after my presenations, like what I had to offer was very interesting to them.
More importantly, in intermission I had three people come up and directly compliment my app, offer their direct feedback(which was great) and wanted to know my current employment status.<br>
I was floating.<br><br>
I had so much fun at The Iron Yard.<br>
Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn an insane amount of content in a short amount of time.
It requires dedication. You will get out what you put into it.
Being satisfied by getting the work done isn&rsquo;t enough.
You have to push yourself and take what is given and throw it up a couple of levels.<br>
Don&rsquo;t like the page having refresh over and over? Use Ajax, or something like AngularJS.<br>
The beginning Ruby assignments seem easy to you? Write tests for them, or throw up your work on sinatra. <br>
There are countless things to do to push learning to the absolute maximum, and it all falls on your dedication.
I loved every bit of being there, I don&rsquo;t regret a day I spent at The Iron Yard.
I feel 100% confident I can solve many complex problems I don&rsquo;t have the answer to, and that is because of my training.
Now the job hunt begins, and I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;ll be too stressful because of how much weight the name &ldquo;The Iron Yard&rdquo; holds.
<br>
Life is pretty great when you push yourself.</p>
