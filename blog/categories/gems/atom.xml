    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is becoming a trend for websites to enable logging into that website
via another.<br>
We&rsquo;ve all seen it.
The buttons that say &ldquo;Sign in with Facebook&rdquo;, or various other
providers.
For some reason unknown to me (really unknown to me because I don&rsquo;t
use social media), seeing these logins provide some kind of weird
validity to a website.
It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, they are connected with facebook, they must be credible&rdquo;.
When I know perfectly well that its just a little bit of code hooking into
the facebook api.
Regardless, implementing these login features for a user is a
great strategy from a user experience (UX) standpoint.<br><br>
Over the next few blog posts I&rsquo;m going to go over step by step
using provider authentication, and being able to use multiple
providers for the same user.
I feel logging into various providers is a valuable skill for every Rails developer, and
a great tool to be able to use.<br>
In the upcoming posts, I&rsquo;ll use Amazon and Google as my examples.
I&rsquo;ll also detail what is needed to add another provider, and some quirks
about certain ones (Twitter).</p>
