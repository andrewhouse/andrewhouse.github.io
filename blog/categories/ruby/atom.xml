    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Javascript was my first programming language.
While it was fun to use, it was also very syntax heavy.
The amount of ()&rsquo;s and {}&rsquo;s pretty much drove me insane.  <br>
After learning the basics of Javascript I started to look for other
languages that would be relevant to my goal of web development.
I had come to learn how Javascript was incredibly important making web
pages function, and I wanted to learn the skills to drive the essential
pieces that run in the background. That&rsquo;s right, I wanted to take a look
into the back-end. <br></p>

<p>After researching for countless days I finally stumbled upon Ruby on Rails.
It seemed that Rails was a great way to start looking into the backend.
However, the majority of places I saw said to absolutly not start Rails
until I was fluent in Ruby.
Then a lightbulb moment came.
I remember seeing a Ruby course when I was going over the Javascript codeacademy
course.
There I went, headfirst into Ruby without a clue of what it was.<br><br>
I thought Ruby was joking with me.
Hardly any ()&rsquo;s and only {}&rsquo;s with hashes and blocks. Are you serious?
It was fluid, less verbose, and object oriented.
I fell head over heels.
From that point on I focused mainly on Ruby and learning how to properly structure
methods, classes, and everything I could.
I&rsquo;ve got to the point to where just getting something to work the way I want to isn&rsquo;t
enought, I need to have it be in best practice.
Using proper standards and conventions adopted by professionals.
Ruby is a ton of fun.
I&rsquo;m incredibly passionate about it and it has made me a more passionate developer.<br><br>
Ruby pulled me into it&rsquo;s world and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.
From there I went to learn basic Rails and make a few web apps of my own.
Currently, I am attending the IronYard in Atlanta, GA to learn more
advanced Ruby and Rails.
By the end of this I feel I will be absolutely be prepared to be a critical
asset to any team. <br><br>
I have Ruby to thank for all of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to think of writing code similar to designing puzzles.
The more simple the code, the easier to dissect each individual element and
know the code with exact precision.
However, I have a fondness for diving deep into code I don&rsquo;t understand.
One of my favorite things to do is to find a method on ruby-docs that I know
nothing about, and pick it apart piece by piece.
Originally, I used mass amounts of puts and tabbing back and forth between
my editor and irb. During my first day at the IronYard my Instructor James
introduced me to Pry. <br><br></p>

<p>Let me say, pry is a dream. <br><br>
Pry is pretty sweet because I&rsquo;m able to use pry in place of irb.
It also uses a colorized
text to help me instantly recognize what the type the presented code is.
For me, the most powerful feature of pry is <code>binding.pry</code>.
When I&rsquo;m wanting to find out what a particular piece of code is doing
at a specific point in time, I drop <code>binding.pry</code> at that specific
line. Then when I run the code, pry automatically opens and I&rsquo;m given the ability
to check specific states of code, even during complicated loops.
In addition, I like to use the pry-byebug gem to be able to go line by line,
continuously being able to check code and debug/figure out whats going on.<br><br>
As a Junior Dev I find these practices to be crucial.
There are plenty of times I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, and by calmly
dissecting the code, I can pull myself through even the hardest bits of code.</p>
