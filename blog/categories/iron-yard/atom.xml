    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the Front End course for The Iron Yard students in Atlanta showed their
final projects.<br>
I thought it was a very interesting experience.
There were probably around 50-60 people attending, some Iron Yard affiliated, and
some potential employers.
And everyone was there to see the final projects for a few individuals.
It kind of got my blood pumping.
In just two short months I will be up on the stage showing off whatever
project it is that I do.
Our class (Ruby on Rails) will be giving their presentations at the same time
as the IOS class.
Which means my project needs to be twice as amazing as everyone elses.
The pressure is on, the timer has started.
There will be a ton of code cranked out in a few months.
Now I just have to figure out what in the hell I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
