    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to be full stack would be fun. <br>
I&rsquo;m starting to progress nicely in implementing rails features, and my instructor
James suggested that I take an interest in learning and implementing a
front end client.
I had taken the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">Code School Course</a>
on starting Angular JS and I liked it&rsquo;s flow.
The framework seemed less verbose than Backbone JS, although it&rsquo;s entire syntax
structure is odd at first.
I like the way it read on an html page.
I know that sounds weird with all of the controller&rsquo;s and directives, but I dig it.<br><br>
Since I took this course a few months ago, I&rsquo;m going to go through it again to
freshen up on the basics.
After that I&rsquo;m going to go through the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/">Tutorial</a>
on the Angular JS Documentation.
Once I get a good feeling of the flow of Angular, I&rsquo;m probably going to try and
implement it into my <a href="tiy-homework.herokuapp.com">The Iron Yard Homework App</a>.
I know it will be a long road to get a feeling of the flow of Angular JS, but I
feel like in the end, it will be a valuable skill to have.</p>
