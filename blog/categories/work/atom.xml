    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We go through material so fast at The Iron Yard.<br>
It isn&rsquo;t like we go through things too fast, but just fast enough
to understand everything.
I personally have a tendency to forget basic syntax when blazing through
new material.<br>
Do I put a semi-colon here or wrap it in quotation marks?<br>
Do I need curly brackets here?<br>
Little details like that come up often in my brain.
I find it helpful to try to not remember the exact syntax, but where
I wrote code similar to that to reference.
That way I&rsquo;m not trying to rush and memorize specific syntax, but
over time as I continuously refer to my own work it will become
more normal.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy looking at code that I have wrote before.
Especially code that I don&rsquo;t remember.
I can see my progress and have the &ldquo;what was I thinking when I wrote this?&rdquo;
moments.
To be able to mock my previous self is crucial in self evolution.
See what I did, and make it better.
Then I&rsquo;m not just referencing some article online, but take something
that I put time into and make a new reference by upgrading it.
There is always something to do.
Code can always be smaller, faster, and more efficient.
It&rsquo;s my job to find a perfect balance between those and the time it takes
to write the code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been living in a state of being uncomfortable.<br>
It&rsquo;s a weird feeling.
Always having to look up resources, reading articles, and watching videos.<br>
It is constant learning.<br>
At first, this style was incredibly uneasy.
I would feel constantly anxious and stressed.
Why didn&rsquo;t I have the answers?
Why was I having such a hard time finding answers?
There is a great skill in asking the right questions, and a very valuable lesson
I learned.
I think my next blog post will be how to google 101, or googling for rails dummies.
The evolution of my ability to see through what problem I am facing and
being able to search for that specific problem has been astonishing.
I&rsquo;m starting to transition from being uneasy all the time to enjoying the hunt.<br><br>
Where are the answers?<br>
Which answer is the best for my needs?<br>
Can I tweak the answer to get better results?<br><br>
I feel like this is a great mentality to have.
To be always improving is what it takes to be a developer.
Breaking my old ways of doing what it is easy, digging into the trenches,
and putting some sweat equity into me.
It&rsquo;s a pretty rewarding feeling.
Looking at myself from the outside in and noticing a change.
I am so glad that I am coding.
It truly was a life altering choice to come to The Iron Yard.
Not only will I become a badass Rails Dev, but I will also be closer to
my true self.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electricity sure is annoying.<br>
I end up using it most of the day.
Whether it be by charging my laptop, heating up dinner, or watching tv.
Electricity encompasses my life.<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t particularly like it, I just hate being dependent on
factors I can&rsquo;t control.
Currently the power is out at my apartment and I find it incredibly frustrating.
The thought of how we will use power in the future gives me great joy.
Affordable personal solar panels that are easy to diagnose? Yes please.
I&rsquo;d even take a Soylent Green-esque treadmill that could power my apartment.<br><br>
I know that I&rsquo;m overly dependent on electricity; my profession pretty much relies on it.
If something happened and we went back to the stone age, I would be royally screwed.
I do enjoy the era I was born into, and I look forward to the future and what
humanity will come up with to fill the void for everyone.</p>
