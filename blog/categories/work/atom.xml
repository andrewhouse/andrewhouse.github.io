    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electricity sure is annoying.<br>
I end up using it most of the day.
Whether it be by charging my laptop, heating up dinner, or watching tv.
Electricity encompasses my life.<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t particularly like it, I just hate being dependent on
factors I can&rsquo;t control.
Currently the power is out at my apartment and I find it incredibly frustrating.
The thought of how we will use power in the future gives me great joy.
Affordable personal solar panels that are easy to diagnose? Yes please.
I&rsquo;d even take a Soylent Green-esque treadmill that could power my apartment.<br><br>
I know that I&rsquo;m overly dependent on electricity; my profession pretty much relies on it.
If something happened and we went back to the stone age, I would be royally screwed.
I do enjoy the era I was born into, and I look forward to the future and what
humanity will come up with to fill the void for everyone.</p>
