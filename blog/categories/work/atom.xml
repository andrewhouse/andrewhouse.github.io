    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I woke up surprisingly energetic this morning.<br>
I think it is because I feel prepared and excited to give my demo.
The amount of work that has gone into my final project at The Iron Yard has been intense.
The last two weeks I&rsquo;ve worked mostly 10+ hours a day sorting out everything I wanted.
Starting by building an app from scratch, to a finished/polished product that is in working condition.
That was one thing that I wanted from my final project.
Not an app that had hard coded information, or tweaked just for our presentation.
But a real, live, working application that can be used with minimal difficulty.<br><br>
I have had a ridiculous amount of fun these last couple of weeks.
Digging into code, building something that was entirely based on my skill, and being able to show it off to others.
I feel like I&rsquo;m on cloud 9.
It&rsquo;s really a great thing that I scrum&rsquo;d out my workflow as to set specific goals in a timely manner.
I would be freaking out if I still had to work on code today.
It has been stressful, meeting personal deadlines, not knowing how the end product will turn out.
I feel confident now.
My work is great and it is an uplifting feeling to create something by yourself that is a presentable product.
<br><br>
My next post will detail the application that I built.
I&rsquo;ll go over why I built it and for who.
Also I&rsquo;ll post the link for the app and my github.
<br><br>
Many thanks to the folks at The Iron Yard.
It&rsquo;s been a blast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my last week at The Iron Yard.<br>
It feels like the last 11 weeks have flown by, mainly because I have been having a ridiculous amount of fun.
I have been stressed, anxious, and nervous.
Learning how to cope with all is part of being a developer.
To take the negative feelings and look beyond them.
<br>&ldquo;Why am I feeling stressed? I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting this to work.&rdquo;<br>
Understanding yourself and the root of your feelings can be a driving force.
After understanding the stress, I can redirect it into a thirst for knowledge.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be happy and sad after my demo day is done.
Happy that I had completed the course to the best of my abilities, learning so many different things.
Sad that the environment that I have been in, everyone giving 100% to learn, will be over.
But alas!
A new chapter will start, with great people with great purposes.
Life is pretty cool if you give it a chance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s about to get crazy at The Iron Yard.<br>
We have a week and a half of lecture and practice until we begin final projects.
Honestly, I have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to do.
I know that I would love to build a site combining the strengths of Rails backend with Angular JS&rsquo;s front end.
I suck at ideas though.
If I have an idea of what to build, the general idea, then I can run with it and do something fun.
Getting that initial idea is hard as hell for me.
I plan on asking various people to get their advise for what kind of project would be memorable and useable.
From October 3-5 The Iron Yard is doing an internal hackathon (Combination of the Front End, IOS, and Rails classes) and I hope that I get an idea from there that I can run with for my final project.
I would love to work with other classes and form a Scrum centric idea process and work flow to knock down a project.<br> <br>
The last couple of weeks have been group projects for us.
Last week I was the project leader of our group and it was very different experience for me.
I didn&rsquo;t do pure scrum with the group.
I didn&rsquo;t get client input, or make a board.
I kind of winged the inputs in my head to develop a MVP.
This week the leader of our group was a former project manager, <a href="https://github.com/rjgroller">Robert Groller</a>, and knows how to use scrum.
Actual scrum implementation is much different than &ldquo;winging it&rdquo;.
I like the workflow process much better with full scrum.
The timeboxing, workflow, and everything.
I want this process in my final project.
My intention is to have James, my teacher, act as the client and give me feedback on what he thinks a user experience should find important in whatever I do. <br><br>
Now I just need to figure out what I&rsquo;m going to do.
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll figure it out soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We go through material so fast at The Iron Yard.<br>
It isn&rsquo;t like we go through things too fast, but just fast enough
to understand everything.
I personally have a tendency to forget basic syntax when blazing through
new material.<br>
Do I put a semi-colon here or wrap it in quotation marks?<br>
Do I need curly brackets here?<br>
Little details like that come up often in my brain.
I find it helpful to try to not remember the exact syntax, but where
I wrote code similar to that to reference.
That way I&rsquo;m not trying to rush and memorize specific syntax, but
over time as I continuously refer to my own work it will become
more normal.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy looking at code that I have wrote before.
Especially code that I don&rsquo;t remember.
I can see my progress and have the &ldquo;what was I thinking when I wrote this?&rdquo;
moments.
To be able to mock my previous self is crucial in self evolution.
See what I did, and make it better.
Then I&rsquo;m not just referencing some article online, but take something
that I put time into and make a new reference by upgrading it.
There is always something to do.
Code can always be smaller, faster, and more efficient.
It&rsquo;s my job to find a perfect balance between those and the time it takes
to write the code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been living in a state of being uncomfortable.<br>
It&rsquo;s a weird feeling.
Always having to look up resources, reading articles, and watching videos.<br>
It is constant learning.<br>
At first, this style was incredibly uneasy.
I would feel constantly anxious and stressed.
Why didn&rsquo;t I have the answers?
Why was I having such a hard time finding answers?
There is a great skill in asking the right questions, and a very valuable lesson
I learned.
I think my next blog post will be how to google 101, or googling for rails dummies.
The evolution of my ability to see through what problem I am facing and
being able to search for that specific problem has been astonishing.
I&rsquo;m starting to transition from being uneasy all the time to enjoying the hunt.<br><br>
Where are the answers?<br>
Which answer is the best for my needs?<br>
Can I tweak the answer to get better results?<br><br>
I feel like this is a great mentality to have.
To be always improving is what it takes to be a developer.
Breaking my old ways of doing what it is easy, digging into the trenches,
and putting some sweat equity into me.
It&rsquo;s a pretty rewarding feeling.
Looking at myself from the outside in and noticing a change.
I am so glad that I am coding.
It truly was a life altering choice to come to The Iron Yard.
Not only will I become a badass Rails Dev, but I will also be closer to
my true self.</p>
