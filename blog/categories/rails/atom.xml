    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being entirely void of creativity, the <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">Twitter Bootstrap Rails Gem</a>
is amazing.<br>
I use Twitter Bootstrap(bootstrap for short) to generate basic layouts so I
can get a handle on how things can possibly look.
Not to mention, it gives an amazing starting point for building good looking css.
If you visit the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Twitter Bootstrap Home Page</a>,
you can see all of the styles you can create.
If you are a beginniner, ignore anything and everything Javascript related.
Stick primarily to the CSS and Components page and customize your page with
their features.
A little pizzazz goes a long way ya&#8217; know. <br></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>I am assuming that you have a new rails project and are looking to add bootstrap
to that project.<br><br>
Let&rsquo;s start by adding the &lsquo;twitter-bootstrap-rails&rsquo; gem to the Gemfile.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">twitter</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">bootstrap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">rails</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rsquo</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>ALWAYS</strong> After you update your Gemfile in any way, run bundler.
Now open up your terminal/iTerm/command prompt.
The rest of generating default bootstrap logic will be done from the terminal.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<em>Note: bundle is shorthand for bundle install.</em><br><br>
Next, we need to generate the bootstrap into our Rails app.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rails generate bootstrap:install static
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<em>Note: g is shorthand for generate when Rails is the context.</em></p>

<h3>Generating the Default Layout Page</h3>


<p>Now bootstrap has been installed into your Rails app and you can access bootstrap
logic if you want to completely customize your page.
However, bootstrap can help generate default layouts for your application.html page and
the generated views.<br>
In order to generate a default layout page, you need to run the following.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rails g bootstrap:layout application fluid -f
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<em>Note: You can run the code without the -f flag. All the flag will do is force the changes
so you don&rsquo;t have to repeatedly say yes to every little thing.</em><br><br>
<em>Note: If you have installed haml or slim and your application file uses those tags,
then bootstrap will install the layout in that format. Cool right?</em><br><br>
Now if you look at your application.html.erb(if you&rsquo;re using erb) you will notice
the drastic change to the html. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of all of the head logic.
Most of it is for mobile and meta data.
If you wanted to go ahead and customize your layout page, you can use
the css or components on the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Twitter Bootstrap Page</a>.
If there are other types of bootstrap that you want to change.
For example, you hate the color of when you hover over your title on the navbar.
To make changes directly to the css go to <em>&lsquo;./app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css&rsquo;</em>
and make your customizations there.<br></p>

<h3>Simple Form</h3>


<p>If you are using <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a>,
there is a bootstrap generator for simple form. If you are thinking about
using simple form, do so <strong>before</strong> installing the default views. If not,
the view forms will be installed in the default form format.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">simple_form</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rsquo</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<em>Note: Remember to bundle after changing the Gemfile.</em><br>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle
</span><span class='line'>rails g simple_form:install <span class="p">&amp;</span>ndash<span class="p">;</span>bootstrap
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<h3>Generating Default Views</h3>


<p>The synax for changing the layout of a set of views are.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rails g bootstrap:themed <span class="o">[</span>RESOURCE_NAME<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
Resource name is the name of the <em>controller</em> of which you would like the views
changed. Let&rsquo;s say that you want to make a Posts controller.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Terminal <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rails g scaffold post title:string content:text
</span><span class='line'>rake db:migrate
</span><span class='line'>rails g bootstrap:themed posts -f
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<em>Note: The pluralization is critical.</em><br><br>
<em>Note: Once again, the -f flag is just for saving precious time, it&rsquo;s not necessary.</em><br><br>
Now if you look at the views under <em>&lsquo;./app/views/posts&rsquo;</em> the index and show will now be
in table format. The new and edit views will render the form page.
The form will have a great starting layout. <br></p>

<h3>Now the fun begins!</h3>


<p>This is the true starting point for customizing your page however you want.
The basics have been done, now you don&rsquo;t have an ugly beginning point.
Once again, reference the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Twitter Bootstrap Page</a>
and make every little detail your own.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gem&rsquo;s make my Rails world go round. <br>
However, there are so many gems around that it would take entirely too long
to comb through them all.
I do have a method that helps me select certain gems from others. <br>
<strong>Documentation.</strong><br>
If a gem is lacking in how-to&rsquo;s, tutorials, or efficient documentation-I
typically skip over it.
For example, one of my favorite gems is <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a>.
Simple Form allows forms to be a little easier to read.
My favorite part about it?<br>
Look at all of that documenation on the Github page.<br>
I love it.
There have been situations where I use gems that don&rsquo;t have great documentation.
Typically that is when I&rsquo;m desperate for something and have exhausted my resources.
Odds are, the gem is a failure and I crawl into a little hole for a few minutes.
Alas, gems are great to use and their documentation/codebase allows for steady
knowledge and easy implementation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I LOVE to play around with new features. <br>
Tonight I was playing around with omniauth-github and trying to log in via rails.
I was able to log in (horray!), but I had forgotten what I was supposed to be
doing initially.
It happens to me every now and then; I get feature focused. <br><br>
I&rsquo;m so focused on getting this one little thing to work I lose track of
my goal. It&rsquo;s times like this, when I&rsquo;m barely into the project, and I was
able to get my feature to work.
I find that it&rsquo;s best to scrap it and start over.
My reasoning?<br>
  <li>Start on a path where I am able to remain focused.
  <li>When it is time to create the feature again; I will do it again from scratch,
forcing myself to learn.
  <li>In future projects, I will know to be well prepared and focused from the get go.
<br><br>
Long story short. <br>
I played around with a cool thing, got it to work, messed up, started over, and
didn&rsquo;t loose any passion.
Not a bad thing if you ask me.
I&rsquo;ll learn, grow, and do a better job next time.</p>

    <link href="http://andrewhouse.github.io/blog/2014/08/07/being-object-oriented/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-07T10:02:29-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://andrewhouse.github.io/blog/2014/08/07/being-object-oriented</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love designing classes in an Object Oriented fashion.
It gives a good feeling, like there aren&rsquo;t just a bunch of empty method.
Each method belongs to something larger, each piece makes the whole complete.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) just makes sense to me.<!-- more --> <br><br>
I like to think of classes as factories.
Each factory pumps out a special part thats essential for the whole.
The combination of all of the parts produced by the factories make a larger
object.
Attacking problems this way helps me pre-debug(defensive coding) the situation.
Doing so makes it easier to debug, read, and understand.
<br><br>
Even when not specifically designing Object Oriented features, I still
think of designing projects like objects.
Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m building a rails app.
At the top level there is the MVC(model, view, controller).
From there I break it down into pieces.
Each view has several HTML &amp; CSS files.
Each HTML can have partials, their own css stylings, etc.
I keep breaking every piece down and down to make every little bit easier to
understand.
To me, designing this way helps maintain my sanity and keep organized.<br></p>

<p>Objects are my friends, and designing in such a way isn&rsquo;t too hard of a task.
Just be mindful of the roles each object plays, name them accordingly, and
create the puzzle that holds all the pieces perfectly.</p>

    <id>http://andrewhouse.github.io/blog/2014/08/06/how-ruby-chose-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Javascript was my first programming language.
While it was fun to use, it was also very syntax heavy.
The amount of ()&rsquo;s and {}&rsquo;s pretty much drove me insane.  <br>
After learning the basics of Javascript I started to look for other
languages that would be relevant to my goal of web development.
I had come to learn how Javascript was incredibly important making web
pages function, and I wanted to learn the skills to drive the essential
pieces that run in the background. That&rsquo;s right, I wanted to take a look
into the back-end. <br></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>After researching for countless days I finally stumbled upon Ruby on Rails.
It seemed that Rails was a great way to start looking into the backend.
However, the majority of places I saw said to absolutly not start Rails
until I was fluent in Ruby.
Then a lightbulb moment came.
I remember seeing a Ruby course when I was going over the Javascript codeacademy
course.
There I went, headfirst into Ruby without a clue of what it was.<br><br>
I thought Ruby was joking with me.
Hardly any ()&rsquo;s and only {}&rsquo;s with hashes and blocks. Are you serious?
It was fluid, less verbose, and object oriented.
I fell head over heels.
From that point on I focused mainly on Ruby and learning how to properly structure
methods, classes, and everything I could.
I&rsquo;ve got to the point to where just getting something to work the way I want to isn&rsquo;t
enought, I need to have it be in best practice.
Using proper standards and conventions adopted by professionals.
Ruby is a ton of fun.
I&rsquo;m incredibly passionate about it and it has made me a more passionate developer.<br><br>
Ruby pulled me into it&rsquo;s world and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.
From there I went to learn basic Rails and make a few web apps of my own.
Currently, I am attending the IronYard in Atlanta, GA to learn more
advanced Ruby and Rails.
By the end of this I feel I will be absolutely be prepared to be a critical
asset to any team. <br><br>
I have Ruby to thank for all of it.</p>
