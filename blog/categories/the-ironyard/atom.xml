    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I woke up surprisingly energetic this morning.<br>
I think it is because I feel prepared and excited to give my demo.
The amount of work that has gone into my final project at The Iron Yard has been intense.
The last two weeks I&rsquo;ve worked mostly 10+ hours a day sorting out everything I wanted.
Starting by building an app from scratch, to a finished/polished product that is in working condition.
That was one thing that I wanted from my final project.
Not an app that had hard coded information, or tweaked just for our presentation.
But a real, live, working application that can be used with minimal difficulty.<br><br>
I have had a ridiculous amount of fun these last couple of weeks.
Digging into code, building something that was entirely based on my skill, and being able to show it off to others.
I feel like I&rsquo;m on cloud 9.
It&rsquo;s really a great thing that I scrum&rsquo;d out my workflow as to set specific goals in a timely manner.
I would be freaking out if I still had to work on code today.
It has been stressful, meeting personal deadlines, not knowing how the end product will turn out.
I feel confident now.
My work is great and it is an uplifting feeling to create something by yourself that is a presentable product.
<br><br>
My next post will detail the application that I built.
I&rsquo;ll go over why I built it and for who.
Also I&rsquo;ll post the link for the app and my github.
<br><br>
Many thanks to the folks at The Iron Yard.
It&rsquo;s been a blast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my last week at The Iron Yard.<br>
It feels like the last 11 weeks have flown by, mainly because I have been having a ridiculous amount of fun.
I have been stressed, anxious, and nervous.
Learning how to cope with all is part of being a developer.
To take the negative feelings and look beyond them.
<br>&ldquo;Why am I feeling stressed? I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting this to work.&rdquo;<br>
Understanding yourself and the root of your feelings can be a driving force.
After understanding the stress, I can redirect it into a thirst for knowledge.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be happy and sad after my demo day is done.
Happy that I had completed the course to the best of my abilities, learning so many different things.
Sad that the environment that I have been in, everyone giving 100% to learn, will be over.
But alas!
A new chapter will start, with great people with great purposes.
Life is pretty cool if you give it a chance.</p>
