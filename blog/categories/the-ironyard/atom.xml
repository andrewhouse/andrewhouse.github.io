    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my last week at The Iron Yard.<br>
It feels like the last 11 weeks have flown by, mainly because I have been having a ridiculous amount of fun.
I have been stressed, anxious, and nervous.
Learning how to cope with all is part of being a developer.
To take the negative feelings and look beyond them.
<br>&ldquo;Why am I feeling stressed? I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting this to work.&rdquo;<br>
Understanding yourself and the root of your feelings can be a driving force.
After understanding the stress, I can redirect it into a thirst for knowledge.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be happy and sad after my demo day is done.
Happy that I had completed the course to the best of my abilities, learning so many different things.
Sad that the environment that I have been in, everyone giving 100% to learn, will be over.
But alas!
A new chapter will start, with great people with great purposes.
Life is pretty cool if you give it a chance.</p>
