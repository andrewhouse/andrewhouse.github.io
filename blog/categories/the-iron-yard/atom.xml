    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That was intense.<br>
I had a really fun time this weekend.
It&rsquo;s amazing how much can be accomplished in such a short amount of time.
I went into the hackathon with the mindset of building something that would work when it was over.
I was successful.<br><br>
Our app was a pseudo dropbox that would be used by businesses and allow clients to
download/upload files without making an account.
I took the task of scrumming together a work flow for my team for the weekend,
gathering input from a couple of the pitchers.
Because of this, we never had a situation where we asked what was next.
At the end, I was told that I looked and acted like a project manager.
 Also, our app looked like an enterprise worthy application,
and was planned and built accordingly.
That was a pretty nice ego boost, to get feedback from strangers that my
techniques in building and managing and application are very effective.<br><br>
Working with a front end developer and an IOS developer was very fun.
Being able to cultivate my data to tailor their needs was different.
Our front end developer was very fresh to The Iron Yard (2 weeks in)
and was a stellar developer.
I took the time Saturday to teach him Haml and he took to it quickly(major props to you Dean).
Being on a team like that was worth the whole weekend to me.
To be around minds who also had a thirst for knowldge and had a different perspective on everything.
I look at things very logically, they had a much better perspective on design and user expereience.
I had a great team and more importantly had an absolute blast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So in about 20 minutes the internal hackathon at The Iron Yard Atlanta is going to begin. <br>
I&rsquo;m pretty pumped.<br>
Not really knowing what I&rsquo;m going to be building.<br>
Who I&rsquo;m going to be working with.<br>
If I&rsquo;ll be able to do everything I want to in the time frame (probably not).<br>
All of these variables seem like it&rsquo;s going to bring an epic weekend.<br><br>
The teams are going to be preselected.
Each team will get at least one Rails Engineer, IOS Developer, and Front End Developer.
Most teams will be groups of 3, some groups of 4.
I&rsquo;m hoping to think that my team is going to be extraordinarily bad ass.
Well to be perfectly honest, everyone at The Iron Yard has talent.
Everyone will be able to contribute something.
I know going into it that I want my team to scrum our project.
I already have a nice spreadsheet laid out and ready to go.
Now it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we start.<br><br>
I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
