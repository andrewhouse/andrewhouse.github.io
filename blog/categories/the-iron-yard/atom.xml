    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So in about 20 minutes the internal hackathon at The Iron Yard Atlanta is going to begin. <br>
I&rsquo;m pretty pumped.<br>
Not really knowing what I&rsquo;m going to be building.<br>
Who I&rsquo;m going to be working with.<br>
If I&rsquo;ll be able to do everything I want to in the time frame (probably not).<br>
All of these variables seem like it&rsquo;s going to bring an epic weekend.<br><br>
The teams are going to be preselected.
Each team will get at least one Rails Engineer, IOS Developer, and Front End Developer.
Most teams will be groups of 3, some groups of 4.
I&rsquo;m hoping to think that my team is going to be extraordinarily bad ass.
Well to be perfectly honest, everyone at The Iron Yard has talent.
Everyone will be able to contribute something.
I know going into it that I want my team to scrum our project.
I already have a nice spreadsheet laid out and ready to go.
Now it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we start.<br><br>
I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
