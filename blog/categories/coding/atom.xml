    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is difficult to find the necessary drive to complete tasks.
That doesn&rsquo;t happen to me when I code.
When I get started with an idea or a project, I&rsquo;m fully immersed.
I like to think of it as a coding high.
When I&rsquo;m in the zone, writing remarkably precise and efficient code.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful and beautiful thing.<!-- more --><br></p>

<p>Coding gives me energy.
I find that by coding, I am able to find things that would seem otherwise mundane, fun.
The thrill of going beyond my limits and learning a new skill.
It just puts me in a good mood.<br></p>

<p>I find coding to be extraordinarily soothing.
There is nothing quite like being lost in a piece of code.
When the world falls silent and all that remains are my code and me.
It&rsquo;s a zen like moment, and I have come to appreciate it more and more.</p>
