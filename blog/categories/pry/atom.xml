    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to think of writing code similar to designing puzzles.
The more simple the code, the easier to dissect each individual element and
know the code with exact precision.
However, I have a fondness for diving deep into code I don&rsquo;t understand.
One of my favorite things to do is to find a method on ruby-docs that I know
nothing about, and pick it apart piece by piece.
Originally, I used mass amounts of puts and tabbing back and forth between
my editor and irb. During my first day at the IronYard my Instructor James
introduced me to Pry. <br><br></p>

<p>Let me say, pry is a dream. <br><br>
Pry is pretty sweet because I&rsquo;m able to use pry in place of irb.
It also uses a colorized
text to help me instantly recognize what the type the presented code is.
For me, the most powerful feature of pry is <code>binding.pry</code>.
When I&rsquo;m wanting to find out what a particular piece of code is doing
at a specific point in time, I drop <code>binding.pry</code> at that specific
line. Then when I run the code, pry automatically opens and I&rsquo;m given the ability
to check specific states of code, even during complicated loops.
In addition, I like to use the pry-byebug gem to be able to go line by line,
continuously being able to check code and debug/figure out whats going on.<br><br>
As a Junior Dev I find these practices to be crucial.
There are plenty of times I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, and by calmly
dissecting the code, I can pull myself through even the hardest bits of code.</p>
