    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think API&rsquo;s are amazing.<br>
It&rsquo;s kind of weird how much I&rsquo;m into API&rsquo;s lately.
Yet, I&rsquo;ve only technically made one (and oh my goodness was it a small one).
I hold much value in the flexibility that an API provides.
To be able to talk to multiple devises in different languages by only providing
the necessary data.<br><br>
Data is my thing.<br><br>
It&rsquo;s nice not having to worry about making anything pretty.
If I want to see if my data is working the way I want I can just do a quick curl.
I&rsquo;m currently having a problem figuring out authenticity tokens.
But that is okay, it&rsquo;s just another hurdle to overcome.<br><br>
When I can easily implement an API I feel as though my self worth will go up drastically.
Reason being, at The Iron Yard in Atlanta there are 3 cohorts (currently 2
  since the front end class just graduated) and a well developed API
  could easily tie together all 3 classes.
How cool is that?
To be able to work with multiple people on a singular project.<br>
All because data is badass.<br><br>
I look forward to creating amazing API&rsquo;s in the future and look forward to
understanding enough Angular JS to be able to call on my API&rsquo;s information.
Doing Full Stack work sounds like a lot of work and would be a ton of fun.<br>
I&rsquo;m excited about the future.</p>
