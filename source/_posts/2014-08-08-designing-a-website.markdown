description: "My Thoughts on Designing a Website"
---
An eye for art I do not have. <br>
I can't paint, draw, sculpt or any of the like.
When it comes to making things look good, I have to say that I am a numskull.
However, I think designing a website is incredibly challenging and somehow fun.
I'm not very fluent in css.
I can read it just fine, but when it comes to creating my own css from my own ideas,
I find it hard.
I tend to use tools like Twitter Bootstrap, ones that can give a default layout
and style without me having to give it much thought.
After a talk today with Sam Kapila, I felt a little at ease when thinking about
web design.
<br><br>
It's all about the User Experience. <br>
Making the person who is going to read my page to feel comfortable.
Not having to search for what they need, making it very clear, and using tools/tricks
to have a much easier reading experience.
For example, something as simple as not having the lines of text too close together.
I typically don't think about things like that.
I have a very backend oriented brain.
I just needed to use my perspective to design. <br>
Then I had a lightbulb moment.<br>
Pay attention to certain details on websites that annoy me and don't do that(also the opposite).
It's simple.
Do I hate that color? DON'T DO IT. Do I like the way that navigation is laid out?
Inspect that element and see what they did.
I believe I'm making designing harder than it is.
I just have to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) it a little.
