description: "Starting to learn Angular JS"
---
I've decided to be full stack would be fun. <br>
I'm starting to progress nicely in implementing rails features, and my instructor
James suggested that I take an interest in learning and implementing a
front end client.
I had taken the [Code School Course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)
on starting Angular JS and I liked it's flow.
The framework seemed less verbose than Backbone JS, although it's entire syntax
structure is odd at first.
I like the way it read on an html page.
I know that sounds weird with all of the controller's and directives, but I dig it.<br><br>
Since I took this course a few months ago, I'm going to go through it again to
freshen up on the basics.
After that I'm going to go through the [Tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/)
on the Angular JS Documentation.
Once I get a good feeling of the flow of Angular, I'm probably going to try and
implement it into my [The Iron Yard Homework App](http://tiy-homework.herokuapp.com).
I know it will be a long road to get a feeling of the flow of Angular JS, but I
feel like in the end, it will be a valuable skill to have.
