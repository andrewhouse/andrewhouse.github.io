We go through material so fast at The Iron Yard.<br>
It isn't like we go through things too fast, but just fast enough
to understand everything.
I personally have a tendency to forget basic syntax when blazing through
new material.<br>
Do I put a semi-colon here or wrap it in quotation marks?<br>
Do I need curly brackets here?<br>
Little details like that come up often in my brain.
I find it helpful to try to not remember the exact syntax, but where
I wrote code similar to that to reference.
That way I'm not trying to rush and memorize specific syntax, but
over time as I continuously refer to my own work it will become
more normal.<br><br>
Personally, I enjoy looking at code that I have wrote before.
Especially code that I don't remember.
I can see my progress and have the "what was I thinking when I wrote this?"
moments.
To be able to mock my previous self is crucial in self evolution.
See what I did, and make it better.
Then I'm not just referencing some article online, but take something
that I put time into and make a new reference by upgrading it.
There is always something to do.
Code can always be smaller, faster, and more efficient.
It's my job to find a perfect balance between those and the time it takes
to write the code.
