I think API's are amazing.<br>
It's kind of weird how much I'm into API's lately.
Yet, I've only technically made one (and oh my goodness was it a small one).
I hold much value in the flexibility that an API provides.
To be able to talk to multiple devises in different languages by only providing
the necessary data.<br><br>
Data is my thing.<br><br>
It's nice not having to worry about making anything pretty.
If I want to see if my data is working the way I want I can just do a quick curl.
I'm currently having a problem figuring out authenticity tokens.
But that is okay, it's just another hurdle to overcome.<br><br>
When I can easily implement an API I feel as though my self worth will go up drastically.
Reason being, at The Iron Yard in Atlanta there are 3 cohorts (currently 2
  since the front end class just graduated) and a well developed API
  could easily tie together all 3 classes.
How cool is that?
To be able to work with multiple people on a singular project.<br>
All because data is badass.<br><br>
I look forward to creating amazing API's in the future and look forward to
understanding enough Angular JS to be able to call on my API's information.
Doing Full Stack work sounds like a lot of work and would be a ton of fun.<br>
I'm excited about the future.
