description: "Electricity and Me"

Electricity sure is annoying.<br>
I end up using it most of the day.
Whether it be by charging my laptop, heating up dinner, or watching tv.
Electricity encompasses my life.<br>
I'm not saying I don't particularly like it, I just hate being dependent on
factors I can't control.
Currently the power is out at my apartment and I find it incredibly frustrating.
The thought of how we will use power in the future gives me great joy.
Affordable personal solar panels that are easy to diagnose? Yes please.
I'd even take a Soylent Green-esque treadmill that could power my apartment.<br><br>
I know that I'm overly dependent on electricity; my profession pretty much relies on it.
If something happened and we went back to the stone age, I would be royally screwed.
I do enjoy the era I was born into, and I look forward to the future and what
humanity will come up with to fill the void for everyone.
