description: "My Thoughts on Objected Oriented Programming"
---
I love designing classes in an Object Oriented fashion.
It gives a good feeling, like there aren't just a bunch of empty method.
Each method belongs to something larger, each piece makes the whole complete.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) just makes sense to me.<!-- more --> <br><br>
I like to think of classes as factories.
Each factory pumps out a special part thats essential for the whole.
The combination of all of the parts produced by the factories make a larger
object.
Attacking problems this way helps me pre-debug(defensive coding) the situation.
Doing so makes it easier to debug, read, and understand.
<br><br>
Even when not specifically designing Object Oriented features, I still
think of designing projects like objects.
Let's say I'm building a rails app.
At the top level there is the MVC(model, view, controller).
From there I break it down into pieces.
Each view has several HTML & CSS files.
Each HTML can have partials, their own css stylings, etc.
I keep breaking every piece down and down to make every little bit easier to
understand.
To me, designing this way helps maintain my sanity and keep organized.<br>

Objects are my friends, and designing in such a way isn't too hard of a task.
Just be mindful of the roles each object plays, name them accordingly, and
create the puzzle that holds all the pieces perfectly.
