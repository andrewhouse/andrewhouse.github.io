description: "How I Redesign an App"
---
I'm learning things way too fast.<br>
Currently I am in the process of building a web app for my class at The
Iron Yard.
The app is a centralized place where the teacher can post assignments
and we can post a link to our assignment and check to see if it is finished
or not.
It's going great and it is working.
However, I want it to do so much more.<br><br>
This weekend I found myself making profile pages for each user.
I'm not any good at design so it was challenging for me to try to tap into
what little artistic vision I have.
Partway through implementing the design, I kept wanting to work on other
features and develop it so much further.
I want to add a better search feature using Angular (still working on
figuring it out), add a sort function for the assignments, add comments
on each individual assignment a student posts, and so much more!<br><br>
I have ideas galore on how to expand this to fit the needs for our class,
but I don't have enough time to implement them all.
While studying and learning new skills every day, and researching what I need
to do for the app.
I find myself trying to prioritize what features I want to do.
Do I take the least path of resistance and implement what would be easiest?
Or do I study a language I haven't used and try to work in this cool feature?<br><br>
The good news is that I am having fun and want to do them all.
Each feature is in its own a great challenge, and without challenges life is boring.
