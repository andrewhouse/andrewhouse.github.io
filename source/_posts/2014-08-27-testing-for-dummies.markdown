I suck at testing.<br>
There are some things that click, and some that don't.
For me, testing doesn't click.
I understand the benefit of it, helping getting my thoughts in order and
drive code in a structured way.
I don't know if its the specific DSL of using rspec, or what.
But I am not good at it (yet).<br><br>
Since testing is my achilles heel, I've decided to make it my prerogative
to get it down.
I don't want to back away from a challenge just because I don't get it at first.
It's completely okay that I'm not good at testing right now.
The reason I'm at The Iron Yard is because I don't have all the skills required
to be a proficient Junior Rails Developer at my current level.
That's why I'm going to use the time that I have here to master any skills
that I'm not good at.
Testing is currently at the top of my list.
Once I get it down (and I will get it down) I'll move on to the next beast.
Keep knocking them down one after another until I feel confident doing what I'm doing.
Then when I'm confident, look at some amazing code that I don't understand
and begin the journey again.
Learning is an ongoing process and it's something that is needed by a
web engineer.
To be able to continuously challenge myself and push into the next technology.
Adapting, evolving, and challenging.
Three things that I love to do and will continue to do for as long as I can.<br>
Coding is fun.
Always changing and never perfect.
