I never really gave Sinatra a chance. <br>
After reading articles after articles about how much better Rails is than
Sinatra, I kind of swept it under the rug.
I was sooooo wrong. <br>
Sinatra is crazy light weight.
Not as many bells, whistles, and not near as many headaches that come with Rails.
It's simplistic, and I like that.
Today I built [a fun Sinatra app](http://andrew-sinatra.herokuapp.com/ "Andrew House - Sinatra")
and I had a really great time.
I didn't try to make it too complicated, just trying to get used to haml and
getting into the groove of how sinatra should feel.<br><br>
I enjoyed how some of the magic that you take for granted in Rails is peeled
apart in Sinatra.
Making my own get/post requests and assigning routes was fun.
I may be overplaying it, and I know how beneficial rails will be when I take
on a larger app. But I have to say that now I will turn to sinatra for low
level simplistic apps. Kudos to James for making us play with Sinatra.
