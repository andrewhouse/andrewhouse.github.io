Gem's make my Rails world go round. <br>
However, there are so many gems around that it would take entirely too long
to comb through them all.
I do have a method that helps me select certain gems from others. <br>
<strong>Documentation.<strong><br>
If a gem is lacking in how-to's, tutorials, or efficient documentation-I
typically skip over it.
For example, one of my favorite gems is [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form).
Simple Form allows forms to be a little easier to read.
My favorite part about it?<br>
Look at all of that documenation on the Github page.<br>
I love it.
There have been situations where I use gems that don't have great documentation.
Typically that is when I'm desperate for something and have exhausted my resources.
Odds are, the gem is a failure and I crawl into a little hole for a few minutes.
Alas, gems are great to use and their documentation/codebase allows for steady
knowledge and easy implementation.
