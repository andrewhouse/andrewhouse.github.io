description: "When to start over a project"

I LOVE to play around with new features. <br>
Tonight I was playing around with omniauth-github and trying to log in via rails.
I was able to log in (horray!), but I had forgotten what I was supposed to be
doing initially.
It happens to me every now and then; I get feature focused. <br><br>
I'm so focused on getting this one little thing to work I lose track of
my goal. It's times like this, when I'm barely into the project, and I was
able to get my feature to work.
I find that it's best to scrap it and start over.
My reasoning?<br>
  <li>Start on a path where I am able to remain focused.
  <li>When it is time to create the feature again; I will do it again from scratch,
forcing myself to learn.
  <li>In future projects, I will know to be well prepared and focused from the get go.
<br><br>
Long story short. <br>
I played around with a cool thing, got it to work, messed up, started over, and
didn't loose any passion.
Not a bad thing if you ask me.
I'll learn, grow, and do a better job next time.
