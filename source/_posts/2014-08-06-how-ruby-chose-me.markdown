description: "How I came to use Ruby as my primary language"
---
Javascript was my first programming language.
While it was fun to use, it was also very syntax heavy.
The amount of ()'s and {}'s pretty much drove me insane.  <br>
After learning the basics of Javascript I started to look for other
languages that would be relevant to my goal of web development.
I had come to learn how Javascript was incredibly important making web
pages function, and I wanted to learn the skills to drive the essential
pieces that run in the background. That's right, I wanted to take a look
into the back-end. <br>

After researching for countless days I finally stumbled upon Ruby on Rails.
It seemed that Rails was a great way to start looking into the backend.
However, the majority of places I saw said to absolutly not start Rails
until I was fluent in Ruby.
Then a lightbulb moment came.
I remember seeing a Ruby course when I was going over the Javascript codeacademy
course.
There I went, headfirst into Ruby without a clue of what it was.<br><br>
I thought Ruby was joking with me.
Hardly any ()'s and only {}'s with hashes and blocks. Are you serious?
It was fluid, less verbose, and object oriented.
I fell head over heels.
From that point on I focused mainly on Ruby and learning how to properly structure
methods, classes, and everything I could.
I've got to the point to where just getting something to work the way I want to isn't
enought, I need to have it be in best practice.
Using proper standards and conventions adopted by professionals.
Ruby is a ton of fun.
I'm incredibly passionate about it and it has made me a more passionate developer.<br><br>
Ruby pulled me into it's world and I couldn't be happier.
From there I went to learn basic Rails and make a few web apps of my own.
Currently, I am attending the IronYard in Atlanta, GA to learn more
advanced Ruby and Rails.
By the end of this I feel I will be absolutely be prepared to be a critical
asset to any team. <br><br>
I have Ruby to thank for all of it.
