    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to think of writing code similar to designing puzzles.
The more simple the code, the easier to dissect each individual element and
know the code with exact precision.
However, I have a fondness for diving deep into code I don&rsquo;t understand.
One of my favorite things to do is to find a method on ruby-docs that I know
nothing about, and pick it apart piece by piece.
Originally, I used mass amounts of puts and tabbing back and forth between
my editor and irb. During my first day at the IronYard my Instructor James
introduced me to Pry. <br><br>
Let me say, pry is a dream. <br><br>
Pry is pretty sweet because I&rsquo;m able to use pry in place of irb.
It also uses a colorized
text to help me instantly recognize what the type the presented code is.
For me, the most powerful feature of pry is <code>binding.pry</code>.
When I&rsquo;m wanting to find out what a particular piece of code is doing
at a specific point in time, I drop <code>binding.pry</code> at that specific
line. Then when I run the code, pry automatically opens and I&rsquo;m given the ability
to check specific states of code, even during complicated loops.
In addition, I like to use the pry-byebug gem to be able to go line by line,
continuously being able to check code and debug/figure out whats going on.<br><br>
As a Junior Dev I find these practices to be crucial.
There are plenty of times I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, and by calmly
dissecting the code, I can pull myself through even the hardest bits of code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Git is glorious. <br>
I once thought it was annoying, countless <code> git add . </code> followed by<br>
<code> git commit -m &ldquo;why am i doing this?&rdquo; </code> <br> <br>
My initial understanding of git was limited. I understood it was a VCM (Version
  Control Manager), but didn&rsquo;t really grasp how powerful it was to backup code. <br></p>

<p>First, the difference between Git and GitHub. Git is what is used on your machine, it
is a tool to decide what files need to be added (staged) and commited (ready to be uploaded).
Then git connects to GitHub as a centralized place to store all of the files that are commited
and ready to be uploaded. <br>
<br> Boom, magic is born. <br><br>
It&rsquo;s a beautiful combination. To be able to look at your code from any machine, always
be able to clone down copies or look what you did last week and figure out why you did it.
When others are added to the equation is when using GitHub becomes a beast. Imagine it,
you&rsquo;re working on a project (hopefully a Rails project) and you&rsquo;ve just finished implementing
a new gem that you found. Your partner (who so happens to be the front end developer) knows
that you have been working on the gem, and that finishing would mean he would only need to make
a couple of tweeks to finish the project. Through github all that is needed is for you to add,
commit, and push your code while your parther pulls it down. <br>
BOOM<br>
If that&rsquo;s not magic idk what is. <br>
Once again, git is glorious. If you&rsquo;re starting out and are hesitant about using git,
just keep in mind that git will be your best friend. Especially when you
accidentally <code> rm -rf </code> (don&rsquo;t do this on files/folders if you don&rsquo;t know what it is)
a few files and you think the world is about to end (it happens).<br><br>
Look up tutorials, watch videos, and ask people who have been using it.
Getting git is an extremely powerful tool any developer can have, and I am very
glad that I took the time to understand its power.</p>
