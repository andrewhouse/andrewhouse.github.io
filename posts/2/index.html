  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being entirely void of creativity, the <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">Twitter Bootstrap Rails Gem</a>
is amazing.<br>
I use Twitter Bootstrap(bootstrap for short) to generate basic layouts so I
can get a handle on how things can possibly look.
Not to mention, it gives an amazing starting point for building good looking css.
If you visit the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Twitter Bootstrap Home Page</a>,
you can see all of the styles you can create.
If you are a beginniner, ignore anything and everything Javascript related.
Stick primarily to the CSS and Components page and customize your page with
their features.
A little pizzazz goes a long way ya&#8217; know. <br></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>I am assuming that you have a new rails project and are looking to add bootstrap
to that project.<br><br>
Let&rsquo;s start by adding the &lsquo;twitter-bootstrap-rails&rsquo; gem to the Gemfile.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile</span><a href='https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;twitter-bootstrap-rails&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gem&rsquo;s make my Rails world go round. <br>
However, there are so many gems around that it would take entirely too long
to comb through them all.
I do have a method that helps me select certain gems from others. <br>
<strong>Documentation.</strong><br>
If a gem is lacking in how-to&rsquo;s, tutorials, or efficient documentation-I
typically skip over it.
For example, one of my favorite gems is <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a>.
Simple Form allows forms to be a little easier to read.
My favorite part about it?<br>
Look at all of that documenation on the Github page.<br>
I love it.
There have been situations where I use gems that don&rsquo;t have great documentation.
Typically that is when I&rsquo;m desperate for something and have exhausted my resources.
Odds are, the gem is a failure and I crawl into a little hole for a few minutes.
Alas, gems are great to use and their documentation/codebase allows for steady
knowledge and easy implementation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never really gave Sinatra a chance. <br>
After reading articles after articles about how much better Rails is than
Sinatra, I kind of swept it under the rug.
I was sooooo wrong. <br>
Sinatra is crazy light weight.
Not as many bells, whistles, and not near as many headaches that come with Rails.
It&rsquo;s simplistic, and I like that.
Today I built <a href="http://andrew-sinatra.herokuapp.com/" title="Andrew House - Sinatra">a fun Sinatra app</a>
and I had a really great time.
I didn&rsquo;t try to make it too complicated, just trying to get used to haml and
getting into the groove of how sinatra should feel.<br><br>
I enjoyed how some of the magic that you take for granted in Rails is peeled
apart in Sinatra.
Making my own get/post requests and assigning routes was fun.
I may be overplaying it, and I know how beneficial rails will be when I take
on a larger app. But I have to say that now I will turn to sinatra for low
level simplistic apps. Kudos to James for making us play with Sinatra.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I LOVE to play around with new features. <br>
Tonight I was playing around with omniauth-github and trying to log in via rails.
I was able to log in (horray!), but I had forgotten what I was supposed to be
doing initially.
It happens to me every now and then; I get feature focused. <br><br>
I&rsquo;m so focused on getting this one little thing to work I lose track of
my goal. It&rsquo;s times like this, when I&rsquo;m barely into the project, and I was
able to get my feature to work.
I find that it&rsquo;s best to scrap it and start over.
My reasoning?<br>
  <li>Start on a path where I am able to remain focused.
  <li>When it is time to create the feature again; I will do it again from scratch,
forcing myself to learn.
  <li>In future projects, I will know to be well prepared and focused from the get go.
<br><br>
Long story short. <br>
I played around with a cool thing, got it to work, messed up, started over, and
didn&rsquo;t loose any passion.
Not a bad thing if you ask me.
I&rsquo;ll learn, grow, and do a better job next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An eye for art I do not have. <br>
I can&rsquo;t paint, draw, sculpt or any of the like.
When it comes to making things look good, I have to say that I am a numskull.
However, I think designing a website is incredibly challenging and somehow fun.
I&rsquo;m not very fluent in css.
I can read it just fine, but when it comes to creating my own css from my own ideas,
I find it hard.
I tend to use tools like Twitter Bootstrap, ones that can give a default layout
and style without me having to give it much thought.
After a talk today with Sam Kapila, I felt a little at ease when thinking about
web design.
<br><br>
It&rsquo;s all about the User Experience. <br>
Making the person who is going to read my page to feel comfortable.
Not having to search for what they need, making it very clear, and using tools/tricks
to have a much easier reading experience.
For example, something as simple as not having the lines of text too close together.
I typically don&rsquo;t think about things like that.
I have a very backend oriented brain.
I just needed to use my perspective to design. <br>
Then I had a lightbulb moment.<br>
Pay attention to certain details on websites that annoy me and don&rsquo;t do that(also the opposite).
It&rsquo;s simple.
Do I hate that color? DON&rsquo;T DO IT. Do I like the way that navigation is laid out?
Inspect that element and see what they did.
I believe I&rsquo;m making designing harder than it is.
I just have to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) it a little.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Electricity sure is annoying.<br>
I end up using it most of the day.
Whether it be by charging my laptop, heating up dinner, or watching tv.
Electricity encompasses my life.<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t particularly like it, I just hate being dependent on
factors I can&rsquo;t control.
Currently the power is out at my apartment and I find it incredibly frustrating.
The thought of how we will use power in the future gives me great joy.
Affordable personal solar panels that are easy to diagnose? Yes please.
I&rsquo;d even take a Soylent Green-esque treadmill that could power my apartment.<br><br>
I know that I&rsquo;m overly dependent on electricity; my profession pretty much relies on it.
If something happened and we went back to the stone age, I would be royally screwed.
I do enjoy the era I was born into, and I look forward to the future and what
humanity will come up with to fill the void for everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love designing classes in an Object Oriented fashion.
It gives a good feeling, like there aren&rsquo;t just a bunch of empty method.
Each method belongs to something larger, each piece makes the whole complete.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) just makes sense to me.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes it is difficult to find the necessary drive to complete tasks.
That doesn&rsquo;t happen to me when I code.
When I get started with an idea or a project, I&rsquo;m fully immersed.
I like to think of it as a coding high.
When I&rsquo;m in the zone, writing remarkably precise and efficient code.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful and beautiful thing.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Javascript was my first programming language.
While it was fun to use, it was also very syntax heavy.
The amount of ()&rsquo;s and {}&rsquo;s pretty much drove me insane.  <br>
After learning the basics of Javascript I started to look for other
languages that would be relevant to my goal of web development.
I had come to learn how Javascript was incredibly important making web
pages function, and I wanted to learn the skills to drive the essential
pieces that run in the background. That&rsquo;s right, I wanted to take a look
into the back-end. <br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like to think of writing code similar to designing puzzles.
The more simple the code, the easier to dissect each individual element and
know the code with exact precision.
However, I have a fondness for diving deep into code I don&rsquo;t understand.
One of my favorite things to do is to find a method on ruby-docs that I know
nothing about, and pick it apart piece by piece.
Originally, I used mass amounts of puts and tabbing back and forth between
my editor and irb. During my first day at the IronYard my Instructor James
introduced me to Pry. <br><br></p>
