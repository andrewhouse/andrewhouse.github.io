  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suck at testing.<br>
There are some things that click, and some that don&rsquo;t.
For me, testing doesn&rsquo;t click.
I understand the benefit of it, helping getting my thoughts in order and
drive code in a structured way.
I don&rsquo;t know if its the specific DSL of using rspec, or what.
But I am not good at it (yet).<br><br>
Since testing is my achilles heel, I&rsquo;ve decided to make it my prerogative
to get it down.
I don&rsquo;t want to back away from a challenge just because I don&rsquo;t get it at first.
It&rsquo;s completely okay that I&rsquo;m not good at testing right now.
The reason I&rsquo;m at The Iron Yard is because I don&rsquo;t have all the skills required
to be a proficient Junior Rails Developer at my current level.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to use the time that I have here to master any skills
that I&rsquo;m not good at.
Testing is currently at the top of my list.
Once I get it down (and I will get it down) I&rsquo;ll move on to the next beast.
Keep knocking them down one after another until I feel confident doing what I&rsquo;m doing.
Then when I&rsquo;m confident, look at some amazing code that I don&rsquo;t understand
and begin the journey again.
Learning is an ongoing process and it&rsquo;s something that is needed by a
web engineer.
To be able to continuously challenge myself and push into the next technology.
Adapting, evolving, and challenging.
Three things that I love to do and will continue to do for as long as I can.<br>
Coding is fun.
Always changing and never perfect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was a mentor at my first hackathon.<br>
Weird right?
The Iron Yard was a sponsor at the <a href="http://forgeatl.com/">Forge Hackathon</a> in Atlanta,
and they asked their students if some of them would like to be mentors.
I thought it would be a great experience to see what a hackathon&rsquo;s atmosphere
is like, and talk to people and see what they&rsquo;re thinking.
So I roll in Saturday morning and sit in a room just for software development.
My role as a mentor was to sit and wait for people to ask for help.
After about 5 minutes of sitting, I was approached by a team looking for help.<br><br>
Their idea was that they were developing a wearable band that doctors were
able to update their personal data.
Such as basic information (name, birthday, etc) and more elaborate data such
as diseases, medication, etc.
The problem they had was that their target locations only had internet once every
few months and didn&rsquo;t know how to store their data locally.
I recommended storing basic data on the wristband (before they were only trying
to store the data on a server with a wristband having only an id).
This way, when the doctor has internet they can push their data up to the server,
allowing the internet copy to be up to date.
The copy on the wristband would be as current as the doctor&rsquo;s version is.
So if they were to move and go to a different doctor, that doctor would
have the most up to date version that their previous doctor had.<br>
Then afterwards I explained strategies to span out their data model into
separate categories to help future expansion and allow for easier transitions
of adding data.
For example, <br>
instead of having a single User table, break medication, doctors, &amp; diseases
into a separate table so that adding and removing data would be much more
efficient. <br><br>
All in all, they seemed to really enjoy my feedback (actually, I asked if
I was helpful and they said I was a huge help).
My first hackathon experience was pretty awesome, it helped my resolve in
believing in myself and trusting the knowledge I have to help others.
It&rsquo;s a spectacular feeling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the Front End course for The Iron Yard students in Atlanta showed their
final projects.<br>
I thought it was a very interesting experience.
There were probably around 50-60 people attending, some Iron Yard affiliated, and
some potential employers.
And everyone was there to see the final projects for a few individuals.
It kind of got my blood pumping.
In just two short months I will be up on the stage showing off whatever
project it is that I do.
Our class (Ruby on Rails) will be giving their presentations at the same time
as the IOS class.
Which means my project needs to be twice as amazing as everyone elses.
The pressure is on, the timer has started.
There will be a ton of code cranked out in a few months.
Now I just have to figure out what in the hell I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a problem when it comes to learning new skills/languages.<br>
I am very theoretical minded person in a sense that I could read and watch
videos about anything and be content.
However, I have found that knowledge doesn&rsquo;t stick as well with me if I don&rsquo;t
implement what I have learned.<br><br>
Example:<br>
I&rsquo;m in the process of learning <a href="http://iamandrewhouse.com/blog/2014/08/19/starting-angular-js/">Angular Js</a>
and a few months ago I did the Code School course.
When going over the course again, I noticed that I remembered a lot of theory.
Things like, I&rsquo;m able to make controllers in a separate JS file and integrate
them into the HTML directly. Little detailed parts of a whole I remembered, but
when it came to actual implementation I had forgotten the majority of it.
That allowed me to catch up fairly quickly on what I was doing, I felt
when I was learning it again a kind of snowball effect.
Where everything felt strange at first, but the more I did the quicker it
came back to me.
However, I don&rsquo;t want to fall that far back again.
So this time I&rsquo;m going to try a much different strategy.<br><br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to be full stack would be fun. <br>
I&rsquo;m starting to progress nicely in implementing rails features, and my instructor
James suggested that I take an interest in learning and implementing a
front end client.
I had taken the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">Code School Course</a>
on starting Angular JS and I liked it&rsquo;s flow.
The framework seemed less verbose than Backbone JS, although it&rsquo;s entire syntax
structure is odd at first.
I like the way it read on an html page.
I know that sounds weird with all of the controller&rsquo;s and directives, but I dig it.<br><br>
Since I took this course a few months ago, I&rsquo;m going to go through it again to
freshen up on the basics.
After that I&rsquo;m going to go through the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/">Tutorial</a>
on the Angular JS Documentation.
Once I get a good feeling of the flow of Angular, I&rsquo;m probably going to try and
implement it into my <a href="http://tiy-homework.herokuapp.com">The Iron Yard Homework App</a>.
I know it will be a long road to get a feeling of the flow of Angular JS, but I
feel like in the end, it will be a valuable skill to have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I built an app which some of my fellow students can use as a medium to give
progress on their homework assignments.<br>
<a href="http://tiy-homework.herokuapp.com">My App</a> uses Devise for registering users,
Heroku as the means for depoloyment, and a vast array of fun gems.
The whole point of the app is that there is a central place where our teacher
(James Dabbs) can check our homework progress.
James is the only authorized user (admin) capable of making new assignments.
Then each student can update the status of their homework by selecting a created
assignment, post the link of their website, and check to see if the assignment
has been completed.<br><br>
I think it works pretty well, all of the CSS was done with the help of
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. If you are interested in
checking out my code, I have it posted on <a href="https://github.com/andrewhouse/TIY-Homework-Checker">Github</a>.
<br>
But yea, making apps are fun. I had a lot of challenges in this app.
Something different I did in this that I had never done before was implementing
a has_many_through relationship.
It required me to do quite a bit of reading to see how each piece interacted,
but in the end it was totally worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time when I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing.<br>
I was trying to setup a rails app for my wife and have her family upload
images and a birthday message.
After some research, I decided to use Amazon Web Services to host my images.
I got it configured in my rails app with Paperclip and that is when I made
a fatal, fatal, fatal error.<br><br>
I put in my bucketname and password directly into my code.<br><br>
The following morning, I received a call from Amazon.
Confirming whether I had setup 5 instances across the world racking up $250
overnight.<br>
I freaked out a little.<br>
After getting that resolved, I searched for how I can avoid making that
stupid mistake again.
My research turned up a gem called <strong>Figaro</strong>.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro">Figaro</a> is used to hide confidential information.
Usernames, passwords, you name it and it will store the variables in a file
that will be automatically ignored from git and can easily be configured
for <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. <br></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>As always, you want to start by adding Figaro to your Gemfile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being entirely void of creativity, the <a href="https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails">Twitter Bootstrap Rails Gem</a>
is amazing.<br>
I use Twitter Bootstrap(bootstrap for short) to generate basic layouts so I
can get a handle on how things can possibly look.
Not to mention, it gives an amazing starting point for building good looking css.
If you visit the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Twitter Bootstrap Home Page</a>,
you can see all of the styles you can create.
If you are a beginniner, ignore anything and everything Javascript related.
Stick primarily to the CSS and Components page and customize your page with
their features.
A little pizzazz goes a long way ya&#8217; know. <br></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>I am assuming that you have a new rails project and are looking to add bootstrap
to that project.<br><br>
Let&rsquo;s start by adding the &lsquo;twitter-bootstrap-rails&rsquo; gem to the Gemfile.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile</span><a href='https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gem&rsquo;s make my Rails world go round. <br>
However, there are so many gems around that it would take entirely too long
to comb through them all.
I do have a method that helps me select certain gems from others. <br>
<strong>Documentation.</strong><br>
If a gem is lacking in how-to&rsquo;s, tutorials, or efficient documentation-I
typically skip over it.
For example, one of my favorite gems is <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a>.
Simple Form allows forms to be a little easier to read.
My favorite part about it?<br>
Look at all of that documenation on the Github page.<br>
I love it.
There have been situations where I use gems that don&rsquo;t have great documentation.
Typically that is when I&rsquo;m desperate for something and have exhausted my resources.
Odds are, the gem is a failure and I crawl into a little hole for a few minutes.
Alas, gems are great to use and their documentation/codebase allows for steady
knowledge and easy implementation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never really gave Sinatra a chance. <br>
After reading articles after articles about how much better Rails is than
Sinatra, I kind of swept it under the rug.
I was sooooo wrong. <br>
Sinatra is crazy light weight.
Not as many bells, whistles, and not near as many headaches that come with Rails.
It&rsquo;s simplistic, and I like that.
Today I built <a href="http://andrew-sinatra.herokuapp.com/" title="Andrew House - Sinatra">a fun Sinatra app</a>
and I had a really great time.
I didn&rsquo;t try to make it too complicated, just trying to get used to haml and
getting into the groove of how sinatra should feel.<br><br>
I enjoyed how some of the magic that you take for granted in Rails is peeled
apart in Sinatra.
Making my own get/post requests and assigning routes was fun.
I may be overplaying it, and I know how beneficial rails will be when I take
on a larger app. But I have to say that now I will turn to sinatra for low
level simplistic apps. Kudos to James for making us play with Sinatra.</p>
