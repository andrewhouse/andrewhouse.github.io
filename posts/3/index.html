  <div class="entry-content"><p>I LOVE to play around with new features. <br>
Tonight I was playing around with omniauth-github and trying to log in via rails.
I was able to log in (horray!), but I had forgotten what I was supposed to be
doing initially.
It happens to me every now and then; I get feature focused. <br><br>
I&rsquo;m so focused on getting this one little thing to work I lose track of
my goal. It&rsquo;s times like this, when I&rsquo;m barely into the project, and I was
able to get my feature to work.
I find that it&rsquo;s best to scrap it and start over.
My reasoning?<br>
  <li>Start on a path where I am able to remain focused.
  <li>When it is time to create the feature again; I will do it again from scratch,
forcing myself to learn.
  <li>In future projects, I will know to be well prepared and focused from the get go.
<br><br>
Long story short. <br>
I played around with a cool thing, got it to work, messed up, started over, and
didn&rsquo;t loose any passion.
Not a bad thing if you ask me.
I&rsquo;ll learn, grow, and do a better job next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An eye for art I do not have. <br>
I can&rsquo;t paint, draw, sculpt or any of the like.
When it comes to making things look good, I have to say that I am a numskull.
However, I think designing a website is incredibly challenging and somehow fun.
I&rsquo;m not very fluent in css.
I can read it just fine, but when it comes to creating my own css from my own ideas,
I find it hard.
I tend to use tools like Twitter Bootstrap, ones that can give a default layout
and style without me having to give it much thought.
After a talk today with Sam Kapila, I felt a little at ease when thinking about
web design.
<br><br>
It&rsquo;s all about the User Experience. <br>
Making the person who is going to read my page to feel comfortable.
Not having to search for what they need, making it very clear, and using tools/tricks
to have a much easier reading experience.
For example, something as simple as not having the lines of text too close together.
I typically don&rsquo;t think about things like that.
I have a very backend oriented brain.
I just needed to use my perspective to design. <br>
Then I had a lightbulb moment.<br>
Pay attention to certain details on websites that annoy me and don&rsquo;t do that(also the opposite).
It&rsquo;s simple.
Do I hate that color? DON&rsquo;T DO IT. Do I like the way that navigation is laid out?
Inspect that element and see what they did.
I believe I&rsquo;m making designing harder than it is.
I just have to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) it a little.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Electricity sure is annoying.<br>
I end up using it most of the day.
Whether it be by charging my laptop, heating up dinner, or watching tv.
Electricity encompasses my life.<br>
I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t particularly like it, I just hate being dependent on
factors I can&rsquo;t control.
Currently the power is out at my apartment and I find it incredibly frustrating.
The thought of how we will use power in the future gives me great joy.
Affordable personal solar panels that are easy to diagnose? Yes please.
I&rsquo;d even take a Soylent Green-esque treadmill that could power my apartment.<br><br>
I know that I&rsquo;m overly dependent on electricity; my profession pretty much relies on it.
If something happened and we went back to the stone age, I would be royally screwed.
I do enjoy the era I was born into, and I look forward to the future and what
humanity will come up with to fill the void for everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love designing classes in an Object Oriented fashion.
It gives a good feeling, like there aren&rsquo;t just a bunch of empty method.
Each method belongs to something larger, each piece makes the whole complete.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) just makes sense to me.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes it is difficult to find the necessary drive to complete tasks.
That doesn&rsquo;t happen to me when I code.
When I get started with an idea or a project, I&rsquo;m fully immersed.
I like to think of it as a coding high.
When I&rsquo;m in the zone, writing remarkably precise and efficient code.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful and beautiful thing.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Javascript was my first programming language.
While it was fun to use, it was also very syntax heavy.
The amount of ()&rsquo;s and {}&rsquo;s pretty much drove me insane.  <br>
After learning the basics of Javascript I started to look for other
languages that would be relevant to my goal of web development.
I had come to learn how Javascript was incredibly important making web
pages function, and I wanted to learn the skills to drive the essential
pieces that run in the background. That&rsquo;s right, I wanted to take a look
into the back-end. <br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like to think of writing code similar to designing puzzles.
The more simple the code, the easier to dissect each individual element and
know the code with exact precision.
However, I have a fondness for diving deep into code I don&rsquo;t understand.
One of my favorite things to do is to find a method on ruby-docs that I know
nothing about, and pick it apart piece by piece.
Originally, I used mass amounts of puts and tabbing back and forth between
my editor and irb. During my first day at the IronYard my Instructor James
introduced me to Pry. <br><br></p>

I once thought it was annoying, countless <code> git add . </code> followed by<br>

My initial understanding of git was limited. I understood it was a VCM (Version
  Control Manager), but didn&rsquo;t really grasp how powerful it was to backup code. <br>
